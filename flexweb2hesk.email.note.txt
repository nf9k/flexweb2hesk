     In an effort to better track open requests, we've implemeneted a helpdesk system.  You are receiving this email/ticket notification because we show you having an open request in Flexweb.  If this request is still valid, please respond to the ticket email, which will in turn notify us.  If a response is not received within 30 days of the ticket being created, it will be closed as no longer needed/wanted, along with any accompanying Flexweb records.  Tickets will be addressed in and oldest to newest order.
